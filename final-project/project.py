# This project is going to be a tuner with several options. Specifically, for a
# guitar.

# First is to generate a standing wave of specific frequencies

# Second is going to be interactive to select which note and measure what was
# received and give a good or negative response indicating if it was close enough
# or way off. Floating point value +/- of how far off it was?

# Third is automatic detection. FFT and analyzing peak freqs for the value
# received, and detecting it's closest value.
